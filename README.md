Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This project focuses on image classification and recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is built and trained using TensorFlow/PyTorch, with OpenCV handling image preprocessing and augmentation.

ðŸ”¹ Features:
Deep Learning Model: Implements a CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.
Library Support: Uses TensorFlow or PyTorch for training and inference.
OpenCV Integration: Handles image preprocessing, augmentation, and real-time image recognition.
Custom Dataset Support: Can be trained on user-defined image datasets.
Real-Time Detection: Compatible with webcam input for live image recognition.
ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow / PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
Loads and preprocesses image data using OpenCV.
Builds and trains a CNN model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Evaluates model performance using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices.
Deploys the trained model for real-time image recognition.
